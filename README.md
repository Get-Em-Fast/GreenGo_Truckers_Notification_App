#  GreenGo_Truckers_Notification_App
The idea of this project is to have a small camera that connects to the users phone or tablet via bluetooth (or the user should be able to use their phone or tablets camerea, as well) that points to a dock light while a truck is being loaded/unloaded at the factory, distribution center, story, etc, that notifies the driver by text, alert, or call, when he/she is loaded/unloaded. 
    When a trucker backs into the dock to load/unload, the light will(should) ALWAYS be green. (THIS IS WHERE THE DRIVER CAN INITIATE THE APP TO "WATCH" THE LIGHTS FOR HIM/HER) The light will then turn red, indicating that the dock workers have let the ramp down between the dock and the trailer. (THIS IS THE POINT THAT THE APP STARTS THE SECOND PHASE OF IT\'S JOB......"WATCHING" FOR THE LIGHT TO TURN BACK GREEN)
    During this time, the truck driver SHOULD be able to sleep, and not have to watch the dock light like a hawk for it to turn green, right? Right! But, with some companies, that's not the case. They want the driver to sit up in the drivers\'s seat, while they take 3-4 hours to even START loading/unloading this poor, tired, drivers\'s truck! That'\s a bunch of BS(Been there, done that for years, myself). 
    When he/she is unloaded, the light will turn back to green. (THIS IS THE POINT THAT THIS APP WILL DO IT\'S REAL WORK!) Since the driver backed in and set up the GreenGo App (On green light) to "watch" the dock lights for him/her, the light should have went from green, to red, then green again. Upon the final green light, the GreenGo App, should actually send a text or, better yet, call the driver to let him know the light is green, to go to the office for his/her paperwork, and leave in a "refreshed" state of mind, since he/she got to sleep, instead of watching a stupid light, therefor, making the roads safer for us all!
